\
SensorFail is a Lua application designed to run on the Jeti DS/C/14/16/24 series of transmitters. The function of this application is to allow the user to track telemetry sensors and warn the user with an audible warning in the even the telemetry sensor stops reporting. Setting up sensor tracking involves: \
\
	1) Selecting the sensor to be tracked\
	2) Assigning a switch to activate the tracking (eg. When throttle hold is off)\
	3) Assigning an audio file for the audible warning\
	4) Selecting the repeat pattern of the warning, between no repeat, repeat 3x, and repeat always.\
